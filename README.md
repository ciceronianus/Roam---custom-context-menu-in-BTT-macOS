# Roam - custom context menu made in BetterTouchTool for macOS (beta)

This version is beta and is meant for **tinkeres** :).  

Please, consider the support: https://www.paypal.me/catominor3. It would really help. ðŸŽ‰

**Version:** 1.2

### Installation

1. Download the last version the custom Roam preset.
2. Open BetterTouchTool, then from the menu "Presets", "Import preset".
3. Make sure that the preset is activated. (You can activate it as a secondary preset along your main.)

###Â Use

The custom context menu is defined using multiple "Named Triggers" under "Named & Other Triggers" (incl. those in progress that are not activated now - yes, it is just a **beta**). This makes the whole preset very flexible. You can call the context menu from  any other trigger using its "Named Trigger Name" **Roam_context_menu**. 

E.g., you can map it to a specific gesture on your trackpad or to a specific button on mouse or a specific keyboard shortcut. 

By default, the custom context menu is mapped to **Corner Click Bottom Left**. But feel free to map it to anything you want :).
